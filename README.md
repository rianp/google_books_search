# Google Books Search CLI

**Welcome to the Google Books Search CLI! 
This command line interface allows you to search for books using the Google Books API.**

**My process in crafting this program was as follows: I wrote the MVP first, 
then added classes and broke up methods to adhere to the single responsibility principle. 
Next, I added validation and error handling for various edge cases that I encountered while manually testing. 
Finally, I added testing.**
